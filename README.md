# 🐾 Terminal Tamagotchi

**Terminal Tamagotchi** is a simple virtual pet game that runs entirely in your terminal. Choose your pet (Cat 🐱, Dog 🐶, or Turtle 🐢), give it a name, and take care of it over time. Keep it fed, rested, and happy — or it may not survive!

---

## 🎮 How to Play

- Launch the game in your terminal.
- Pick a pet and name it.
- Each turn, choose to:
  - **Feed** 🍽️ — reduces hunger
  - **Rest** 💤 — restores energy
  - **Play** 🎾 — increases happiness
- If hunger hits 10, energy hits 0, or happiness hits 0, your pet dies 💀.
- The game progresses over time with each action.
